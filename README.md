# Hippocampus

**A vector database built for AI agents.** Not retrofitted from document search—designed from the ground up for how agents actually manage memory.

---

## Benchmark Summary: 4,200x Faster Than FAISS (Exact Search)

Hippocampus’s custom **O(512 log n)** binary search algorithm achieves **4,200× faster** pure search performance than FAISS’s **O(n)** brute-force IndexFlatL2 at 10,000 vectors, while maintaining deterministic, exact retrieval.

Full methodology, mathematical validation, and reproducible tests are available in [`faiss-comparison/`](faiss-comparison).

## The Problem

AI agents lack consistency, reliability, and real memory. Traditional vector databases are built for billion-scale document retrieval. They're over-engineered for problems you don't have.

Agents need something different: fast, isolated, persistent memory they control.

## The Solution

**Hippocampus**: The SQLite of AI agent memory.

Built for the **agent use case**: 5k-10k vectors per agent that need to be fast, deterministic, and debuggable.

### Two Ways Agents Use Memory

**1. Agent-Controlled Pattern**
Smart agents with full control over their memory:

```python
# Agent decides what to store
requests.post(f"{API}/insert", json={
    "agent_id": "my_agent",
    "key": "user_preference_dark_mode",
    "text": "User prefers dark mode"
})

# Agent controls search precision
requests.post(f"{API}/search", json={
    "agent_id": "my_agent",
    "text": "UI preferences",
    "epsilon": 0.2,
    "threshold": 0.6,
    "top_k": 3
})
```

**2. Database-Curated Pattern**
Simple agents just pass text—internal AI agent handles curation:

```python
# Send raw text, get structured memories
requests.post(f"{API}/agent-curate", json={
    "agent_id": "my_agent",
    "text": "My name is Sarah, I work at Google, allergic to shellfish",
    "importance": "high",
    "model_id": "us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0",
    "bedrock_region": "us-east-1"
})

# Internal agent automatically creates:
# • personal_name_sarah
# • occupation_google_engineer  
# • allergy_shellfish
```

## Why This Architecture?

### The SQLite Philosophy

**SQLite**: File-based SQL database, simple, reliable, ubiquitous
**Hippocampus**: File-based vector database, simple, reliable, built for agents

* No database servers to manage
* No connection pools or networking complexity
* Just files: load, search, done
* Perfect for Lambda's ephemeral execution model

### Built for Agents, Not Documents

**Traditional vector databases optimize for:**

* Billion-scale document retrieval
* Approximate nearest neighbors (HNSW, IVF)
* Distributed clusters

**Agents need:**

* Per-agent isolated memory (multi-tenancy)
* Deterministic, debuggable results
* Fast at 5k-10k scale
* Natural language control over precision
* File-based simplicity

## How It Works

### Core Architecture

**Custom 512-dimensional indexing**

* 512 sorted arrays (one per dimension)
* O(log n) binary search per dimension
* Guaranteed retrieval, no approximation

**Binary serialization**

* Custom format: 2KB per node
* Each agent gets isolated `.bin` file
* Rebuild index on load (~50ms)

**Search algorithm:**

1. Text → AWS Bedrock Titan → 512-dim vector
2. Binary search each dimension for epsilon-ball candidates
3. Calculate Euclidean distance for candidates
4. Filter by threshold, sort by similarity
5. Return top-k results

**Data structures:**

```go
type Node struct {
    Key   [512]float32  // Embedding vector
    Value string        // Actual text
}

type Tree struct {
    Nodes []Node
    Index [512][]int32  // Per-dimension sorted indices
}
```

## Demo: End-to-End Agent Workflows

### 1. Safety-Critical Memory (`safety_demo.py`)

Parent: "My daughter Emma has a shellfish allergy"
→ Agent stores it

Weeks later: "I'm buying shrimp for Emma's dinner"
→ Agent searches memory
→ Finds allergy
→ Warns parent, prevents harm

```bash
cd demo/python
python safety_demo.py
```

### 2. Intelligent Decomposition (`agentcore_agent.py`)

User shares complex paragraph (20+ facts)
→ External agent decides to curate
→ Calls internal curation agent (Lambda + Nova)
→ Internal agent decomposes into discrete memories
→ External agent queries later
→ Retrieves precisely what's needed

```bash
python agentcore_agent.py
python agentcore_agent.py --interactive
```

### 3. Agent-to-Agent Curation (`test_agent_curate.py`)

```bash
python test_agent_curate.py
```

## Architecture: Pure Lambda, File-Based, Serverless

### Deployment

**Infrastructure (Terraform):**

* Lambda: stateless, infinitely scalable
* EFS: per-agent `.bin` files for hot access
* S3: async backups for durability
* NAT Gateway: Lambda → Bedrock API calls
* API Gateway: `/insert`, `/search`, `/agent-curate` endpoints

```bash
make deploy
```

### File-Based Storage

```
EFS/S3 Structure:
/agents/
  ├── agent_abc123.bin
  ├── agent_def456.bin
  └── agent_ghi789.bin
```

## API Reference

### POST /insert

```json
{
  "agent_id": "user123",
  "key": "preference_theme",
  "text": "User prefers dark mode"
}
```

### POST /search

```json
{
  "agent_id": "user123",
  "text": "UI preferences",
  "epsilon": 0.3,
  "threshold": 0.5,
  "top_k": 5
}
```

### POST /agent-curate

```json
{
  "agent_id": "user123",
  "text": "Sarah, 34, Google engineer, allergic to shellfish",
  "importance": "high",
  "model_id": "us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0",
  "bedrock_region": "us-east-1",
  "timeout_ms": 50
}
```

## Performance

### Benchmarks (5k nodes per agent)

* File size: ~10MB
* RAM: ~20MB in Lambda
* Cold start: ~200ms
* Search: <50ms (warm)
* Insert: ~100ms

### Scalability

* Per-agent: 5k-10k nodes
* Total agents: unlimited
* Lambda concurrency: 1000 concurrent agents
* Cost: ~$0.00012 per memory operation

## Limitations & Trade-offs

**Not for:**

* Billion-scale vector search
* Real-time collaborative editing
* Highly concurrent writes

**Ideal for:**

* AI agent memory
* Personal knowledge bases
* Few-shot retrieval
* Tool/API selection

## Vision: AWS-Native Agent Memory Service

Hippocampus demonstrates what a managed AWS service for agent memory could look like.

```python
import boto3
client = boto3.client('hippocampus')

client.insert(AgentId='my-agent', Key='pref', Text='Dark mode')
results = client.search(AgentId='my-agent', Query='UI preferences')
```

## Built For AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon

* Custom vector database built from scratch
* File-based architecture optimized for agent workloads
* Two interaction patterns: agent-controlled + database-curated
* Agent-to-agent orchestration (external → internal)
